"""
game_loader.py
Auto-discovers game handler classes from the Games/ directory.

Any .py file in Games/ (except __init__.py and base_game.py) that contains
a subclass of BaseGame is automatically registered. Bad/incomplete plugin
files are silently skipped so one broken handler doesn't break the rest.

Uses spec_from_file_location so folder names with spaces (e.g. "Stardew Valley")
work without needing a valid dotted module path.

Usage:
    from Utils.game_loader import discover_games
    games = discover_games()          # {game.name: BaseGame instance}
    sse = games["Skyrim Special Edition"]
