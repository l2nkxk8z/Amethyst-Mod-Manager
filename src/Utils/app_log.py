"""
app_log.py
Global app log — forwards messages to the GUI log panel when set.

The main app calls set_app_log(log_fn, after_fn) after building the status bar.
Nexus/Utils code calls app_log(msg) so messages appear in the application log panel.

Thread safety: when app_log is called from a background thread, messages are put
on a queue and drained on the main thread via a periodic after() callback. When
called from the main thread, the message is logged immediately.
