"""
gh_sync.py
Background sync of custom game handlers and wizard plugins from the
Amethyst-Mod-Manager ``Resources`` branch on GitHub.

Tkinter-free port of the old ``gui.py`` ``_sync_custom_handlers`` /
``_sync_plugins`` startup helpers, with two Qt-era differences:

* Custom handlers are all fetched from the flat ``Custom Handlers/`` root
  folder — the versioned ``X.Y/`` subfolder walking (``1.3`` etc.) is gone
  because those subfolders were removed from the repo.
* Plugins are fetched from ``Plugins/v2`` (Qt-compatible) instead of the
  ``Plugins`` root, which still holds the Tkinter-only versions.

Both functions run their network + disk work on a daemon thread and swallow
all errors so a startup sync never blocks or crashes the UI. An optional
``on_changed`` callback fires (on the worker thread — marshal to the GUI
thread yourself) when at least one file was written.
