"""
re_pak_patcher.py
Utilities for patching and restoring RE Engine PAK files.

Zeroes out the 8-byte hash field of every PAK entry that matches a deployed
mod file.  The engine uses (hash_lower, hash_upper) as a lookup key — a zero
pair never matches any real filename, so the engine falls back to loading the
loose file from disk (via REFramework's LooseFileLoader hook).

Two PAK versions are supported:

PAK v2.0 entry layout (24 bytes each — RE2 Remake, RE3 Remake):
  0  8   file_offset       int64
  8  8   decompressed_size int64
 16  4   hash_lower        uint32  Murmur3-32 of lowercase UTF-16LE path
 20  4   hash_upper        uint32  Murmur3-32 of uppercase UTF-16LE path

PAK v4.x entry layout (48 bytes each — RE Village, RE4 Remake, RE7, …):
  0  4   hash_lower        uint32  Murmur3-32 of lowercase UTF-16LE path
  4  4   hash_upper        uint32  Murmur3-32 of uppercase UTF-16LE path
  8  8   file_offset       int64
 16  8   compressed_size   int64
 24  8   decompressed_size int64
 32  8   attributes        int64
 40  8   checksum          uint64

Backup format (JSON):
  { "pak": "<abs path>",
    "entries": [ {"index": <int>, "original": "<16-hex-chars>"}, ... ] }
