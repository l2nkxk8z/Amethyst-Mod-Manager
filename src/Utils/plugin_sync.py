"""Sync plugins.txt / loadorder.txt when mods are enabled or disabled.

Tkinter-free port of gui/modlist_panel.py `_sync_plugins_for_toggle` (8730-8776):
disabling a mod removes its top-level plugin files from plugins.txt and
loadorder.txt; enabling appends any that aren't already listed. Unlike Tk (which
re-reads/re-writes both files once per mod), the whole batch is applied in a
single read-modify-write so Enable/Disable-all doesn't do N I/O round-trips.
