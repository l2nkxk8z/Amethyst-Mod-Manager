"""Toolkit-neutral full mod removal — delete a mod's deployed files + staging
folder + index/BSA entries + its plugins from plugins.txt/loadorder.txt.

Ported from the Tk ModListPanel._remove_mod / _remove_plugins_for_mods so the Qt
remove does the SAME complete cleanup (not just dropping the modlist line, which
leaves the files on disk → the mod still reads as installed in the Downloads tab,
and its files stay deployed). Pure stdlib + Utils.* — no GUI toolkit.
